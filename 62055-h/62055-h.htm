<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>DEDICATION.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">TO SIR GEORGE RICH.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir George</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> zeal in the cause of religion,
your accomplishments as a perfect Gentleman, and your virtues as
a true Christian, induce me to dedicate to you the following
avowal of my religious opinions.&nbsp; Though your high
estimation as to public character should demand from me a less
familiar tone of language in addressing you, still the thoughts
of your past kindness, in the hours of my worldly abandonment,
bid me lay aside those expressions which a more formal etiquette
might require, and address you now as I would a true, a sincere,
but most honored and respected friend.&nbsp; As I have received
no special favor from you, but the ordinary manifestation of your
kindness; and as I expect no more than your continuance of such
civility, I hope you will not look upon those words as the result
of adulation, nor the public consider them as the <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>language of
hypocrisy; for adulation never bends without some intended
object, nor does hypocrisy ever act without some hope of
compensation.</p>
<p>I would wish that these dedicatory lines should be also
expressive of my gratitude for the kindness of my lately acquired
friends.&nbsp; The warmth of my feelings urges me on to a public
recital of their names, but a more cool reflection dictates to me
at the same time the propriety of their silence.&nbsp; The useful
instructions they have imparted&mdash;the domestic happiness of
which they had often made me a partaker, and the evident anxiety
they have displayed in contributing to my eternal interests, have
made impressions on my mind which shall never be obliterated.</p>
<p>The proffered liberality of others I shall never
forget&mdash;I mean those, who, when imagining me in a state of
pecuniary embarrassment, have made me a tender of their
purses.&nbsp; But let not my refusal on such occasions bespeak a
want of humility on my part; but rather let it be attributed to
the suggestions of that principle, which told me, that it is
religion, and not emolument, <a name="pagev"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. v</span>which should constitute the chief
object of my change.</p>
<p>While to you, Sir George, and my other lately acquired
friends, I offer the warmest acknowledgement of my gratitude, I
look with pity, at the same time, upon those who are the mere
nominal professors of our faith&mdash;those who court one&rsquo;s
friendship when they imagine that either his name or his presence
would be an addition to their unmerited popularity; but who would
afterwards reject his intercourse, for no other cause than that
of becoming a conscientious member of their religion.&nbsp; Such
nominal adhesion to our faith is sometimes worse in its acts than
the most avowed hostility to our creed.</p>
<p>I met with one or two others, whose elevated rank in life
might point to a more distinguished course in religion, and whose
conduct to me would afford a sufficient subject for complaint;
but as my intended pamphlet is divested of any insidious
reference, this dedication must be also freed from unbecoming
personalities.&nbsp; Let, however, such individuals reflect that,
should I refrain from the following avowal of my <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>sentiments,
the resources of a respectable relationship would furnish me with
the means of independent subsistence.&nbsp; But the advancement
of religion is my object&mdash;conscience must be my
director&mdash;for emolument is not my theme.</p>
<p>Should any portion of the following pages be considered as
couched in the language of either abuse or misrepresentation, let
the fault be ascribed not to the intention, but to the
unconsciousness of the writer; for I have never looked upon
scurrility as proof, nor misrepresentation as argument.&nbsp; The
one prejudices individuals against the writer, while the other
serves only to confirm those errors which a mistaken zeal might
be anxious to correct.</p>
<p>In pursuing those thoughts I find I have exceeded the usual
limits of a dedication; however, I trust that the matter I had to
convey will serve as an apology both to the public and to you, my
dear Sir George, from</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your most obedient and<br />
Ever grateful,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">L. J. NOLAN.</p>

<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span><span
class="GutSmall">TO THE</span><br />
ROMAN CATHOLICS OF IRELAND.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So as much as in me is I am ready to preach
the Gospel to you that are at Rome also.&nbsp; For I am not
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto
salvation to every one that believeth.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rom</span>. i. 15&ndash;16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Roman Catholic Friends</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> months have now elapsed since
my separation from your community.&nbsp; The past delicacy of my
health&mdash;the thoughts of the important duty I have hereafter
to discharge, and a consideration of its awful responsibility,
have obliged me to defer until now the following open avowal of
my religious opinions.&nbsp; But my change in life has not
diminished my ardour for your spiritual interests; on the
contrary, my desires for your eternal salvation have
increased.&nbsp; Your past kindness has a particular claim upon
my gratitude, and highly undeserving should I be in the eyes of
the public, were I to remain unmindful of your generosity.&nbsp;
Yes, I will assert without any fear of contradiction, that there
is no Roman Catholic Clergyman in Ireland could boast of more
acts of attention from a people, than I have experienced from
your hands in the discharge of my clerical duties.&nbsp; Your
actions had ever corresponded with the profession of your
kindness towards me, and your liberality had always stamped the
mark of your approbation upon my <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>conduct in life.&nbsp; But I hope you
will do me the justice in saying, that I have never deviated from
the path of honor to catch the air of a fleeting
popularity.&nbsp; Well then, my dear friends, allow me to submit
a few humble questions in the language of sincerity to your most
serious consideration.&nbsp; But before I do so, do you throw
aside your prejudices&mdash;cast off those thoughts which
unfounded calumnies might suggest to your minds&mdash;and then,
as is mentioned in Isaiah, &ldquo;Come now, and let us reason
together.&rdquo; Isa. i. 18.&nbsp; Why have I left the circles of
your tried friendship, for the uncertainties of yet doubtful
acquaintances?&nbsp; Why have I bartered the smiles for the
insulting sneers of you a once attached people?&nbsp; Why
exchange the scenes of worldly ease, of worldly comfort, and
worldly independence, for the struggles of a more arduous
duty?&nbsp; Are you not aware, that were I to bend the knee of
hypocrisy beneath the mitred head of Roman Episcopal
jurisdiction, and submit to those doctrines which Roman credulity
would impose, there is not one whose prospects would be more
realised, or whose independence more secure?&nbsp; Why have I
retired from the pampered sanctuary of your wealthy church, to
look for shelter beneath the persecution of an insulted
religion?&nbsp; Why have I made such an exchange in life?&nbsp;
Oh, my friends, I will tell you.&nbsp; It is because I have a
poor soul to save, and feel convinced that its salvation could
not be acquired by continuing in the character of a Roman
Clergyman.&nbsp; It is because I have made a solemn promise on
bended knees, and have called upon the heavens to attest the
sincerity of my words, that I would no longer act under the garb
of <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>hypocrisy.&nbsp; It is because, throwing all worldly
concerns out of my view, and banishing all thoughts of a
temporising necessity from my mind, I have at length accepted of
the kind invitation of Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Come out from among
them and be ye separate&mdash;and I will receive you, and be a
Father unto you.&rdquo; 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18.</p>
<p>In adopting my present change in life, I anticipate, more or
less, the difficulties I have to encounter&mdash;the troubles I
have to overcome, and the sacrifices I must naturally make on the
present trying occasion.&nbsp; The friends of my past
life&mdash;the companions of other days, and the acquaintances of
my more mature years, have abandoned me.&nbsp; The very relations
who watched over my infant years&mdash;who led me by the hand
from the cradle of youth into the maturity of life, have also
forsaken me; but Heaven, I trust, has not done so&mdash;God, I
trust, will be my protector; and &ldquo;if God be for us, who can
be against us?&rdquo; Rom. viii. 31.&nbsp; Oh, my friends, let
persons pause before they condemn&mdash;let truth take the place
of falsehood&mdash;let reason but act as the substitute for
prejudice&mdash;and then I will ask the candid mind the important
question, &ldquo;should I remain under a conviction of my
error?&rdquo;&nbsp; Should I, for a mere temporary gratification,
barter an eternal good?&nbsp; Should I, for merely ministering to
the wishes of friends and relations, damn this soul which is
destined for immortality?&nbsp; Oh, my friends, consider me, when
in the character of the Roman Priesthood, and I will again put
the important question, &ldquo;should I remain any longer under a
conviction of my error?&rdquo;&nbsp; Think of me, going from the
sanctuary to the altar, clothed in the priestly vest&mdash;a vest
which I considered <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>as a mere parade of ecclesiastical pomp.&nbsp; Consider
me then as being looked upon as the medium of propitiation
between the living and the dead&mdash;between heaven and
earth&mdash;between man and his Creator, and offering up what was
considered as a sacrifice of propitiation by some, but what was
believed to be only a figure or memorial by me that offered on
the occasion; would I not deserve to be damned&mdash;shall I
repeat the unsanctified expression&mdash;would I not deserve to
be damned for ever, should I continue any longer bending the knee
of hypocrisy beneath the altar of dissimulation?&nbsp; Yes, and
for having continued so long under a conviction of my error, I
now most humbly implore forgiveness, for I should have long since
acted in correspondence with the words of our
Saviour&mdash;&ldquo;For what shall it profit a man if he shall
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&mdash;or what shall
a man give in exchange for his soul?&rdquo; Mark viii.
36&ndash;37.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be asserted by some, that my present change
is the effect of the moment&mdash;that it originates from whim or
caprice, and is not the result of coolness and reflection.&nbsp;
But, my friends, the months that have passed by since the first
open avowal of my sentiments to my then Roman Catholic Bishop, in
the presence of another Roman Catholic Clergyman, would serve as
an answer to such accusations; while my written as well as
personal communications upon this subject, with the truly pious
and Protestant Rector of Castletowndelvin, long previous to the
open announcement of my sentiments to my bishop, must falsify the
assertion, that &ldquo;this change is the result of the
moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Allow me also to tell you, that I have
mentioned my <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>past doubts, not only months, but years ago, to a near
relation, who summed up many a plausible argument to dissuade me
from that course, which, I trust, under the guidance of heaven I
have now adopted: and what is more, in compliance with the
request of my late friends, I have gone to some of the most
distinguished members of the Roman religion, to explain to them
my doubts; but their mystified evasions upon plain and evident
truths, have only tended to confirm me in the conviction of their
errors.</p>
<p>Oh, my friends, my present change is not the effect of the
moment, but it is the effect of a mind that has overcome an
almost invincible prejudice&mdash;a prejudice that grew up with
my youthful days&mdash;that accompanied my more mature years, and
had nearly interwoven itself around the future destinies of my
soul.&nbsp; It is the effect of a mind that has taken
impartiality for its guide, and looked upon truth as the sole
object of its ambition&mdash;a mind that has ruminated day and
night upon the subject&mdash;that has viewed both sides of the
question coolly, attentively, and I trust religiously, and has
now come to this determination, which is founded on a
consciousness of its rectitude.&nbsp; During those hours of
darkness, when &ldquo;sleep falleth upon man&rdquo;&mdash;when
others were taking that repose to which the silence of the night
or exhausted nature might invite them&mdash;I trust it is not too
much the language of egotism for me to say, that during the
silent hours, when thinking of my present change, I had often
bedewed the nightly pillow with the tears of
affliction&mdash;&ldquo;my eye-lids had grown dim with
grief&rdquo;&mdash;my nights were turned into day because of my
watching&mdash;and I could find no rest until I obeyed the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>advice of the
Psalmist, saying, &ldquo;To-day if yon will hear his
voice&mdash;harden not your hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psalm xcv.
7&ndash;8.</p>
<p>There was a period of time which does not require much aid
from memory to bring to your recollection, when political turmoil
had diffused itself over the face of this country&mdash;when the
feelings of charity seemed more or less suspended, and violence
of language was frequently resorted to as the surest mode of
pleasing&mdash;a time when a state of indifference was looked on
as highly criminal, and when, even persons in the sacerdotal
character, had sometimes recourse to political harangues, as a
digest for religious instruction from the altar.&nbsp; At that
time many through motives, perhaps, of ambition&mdash;others
through a desire of vain glory&mdash;while some through a
conviction of its utility, engaged in the political struggles of
the day; and though it may be painful to my feelings to advert to
such a period, still I feel bound to acknowledge, that a mistaken
zeal for religion, unaccompanied with the experience of wiser
days, urged me on as no idle spectator of the scene.&nbsp; But,
blessed be God for all things&mdash;when my mind turned upon the
serious question of religion&mdash;when I looked upon the book of
God as the sole standard of my faith&mdash;when I began to view,
through the medium of impartiality, the important subject of my
eternal salvation, my mind became the more enlarged, and my
thoughts the more expanded by the occurrence.&nbsp; Doubt
followed doubt&mdash;my prejudices began to vanish beneath the
sunshine of a more liberal knowledge&mdash;the elements of
darkness became at length superseded by the glorious principles
of unerring light&mdash;while the effulgence of that religion,
which I had so often misrepresented through life, pierced <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>through the
mystic veil, in which my mind was enveloped, leaving me the
consolation upon this day of being addressed by my Protestant
brethren in the language of the Apostle&mdash;&ldquo;That he
which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which
once he destroyed.&rdquo; Gal. i. 23.</p>
<p>There are some, perhaps, who, if similarly situated as I am,
would prefer the private moment to the public hour for making an
open avowal of their sentiments; but I have considered it to be
the imperative, the indispensable duty of a true convert in
Jesus, to act in conformity with the advice of the Scriptures,
&ldquo;by raising his voice like a trumpet to strengthen his
brethren, and to shew the people their errors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes;
and though the opprobrious epithets of &ldquo;renegade to the
religion of my youth, and apostate from the faith of my
fathers,&rdquo; may be annexed to my present conviction of soul,
still, as St. Paul gloried in the titles of fool, madman, and
apostate, with which disbelief upbraided him on his conversion to
Christianity, so shall I glory in similar appellations,
&ldquo;for I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know, my friends, that among your community there are Roman
Catholic Clergymen who possess the same conviction of soul that I
do, as to the errors of your religion; but the worldly
considerations of present ease and anticipated troubles, prevent
their due exercise of conscience.&nbsp; The unmerited epithet of
apostacy alarms them&mdash;the thoughts of separating from
worldly comforts, from present friends and relations, strike
horror into their souls&mdash;and thus it is that those cares of
passing life supersede the concerns of their eternal
welfare.&mdash;But will they go to the tomb with the
consciousness of <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>such errors as their accompaniment?&mdash;and for those
transitory objects will they destroy that soul which is to be the
heir of immortality?&nbsp; Oh! let them come forth.&nbsp; That
hand which provideth food for the ravens of the air, will also
provide for us, and God will be our defence&mdash;&ldquo;for God
is a shield to those that put their trust in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friends, many of you ask each other, how is it possible
that the Rev. Mr. Nolan, who has spent so many years at his
academical and collegiate course, and upon whose education so
much money and pains had been expended, should only now become a
convert to the Protestant religion?&nbsp; This is a general
question among you all.&nbsp; It was proposed to me a few days
ago at an hotel in Dublin, by a respectable Roman Catholic, one
of the very few, of that persuasion, that has conversed with me
since my change from the Church of Rome.&nbsp; But the answer to
such a question is obvious.&nbsp; The human mind in this instance
may be compared to the human body; for as it advances in years,
it increases in strength; so that some of these doctrines which
were so carefully inculcated during the time of youth, may
afterwards, when placed before the test of wiser days and better
experience, appear in all the inconsistency of their
formation.</p>
<p>Take a short view of the life of an individual who may be
destined from his infancy to discharge the priestly functions,
and your surprise cannot be excited at my deferring my conversion
thus long.&nbsp; Scarcely is the infant tongue formed to
expression, when it is taught to pronounce the names of the Roman
doctrines; and scarcely is the developement of the human mind
discovered, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>when the principles of these doctrines are most
carefully introduced; and then, like the young Scion of the land,
or the tender flower of the field, the youthful mind becomes
susceptible of the first impression.&nbsp; The anxious watchings
of affectionate but misguided parents; the successful examples of
employed attendants, and the well paid services of wily or
deluded instructors, all combine in confirming those opinions
which error had implanted.&nbsp; The individual enters upon his
academical course.&nbsp; There his mind, as to Scriptural
knowledge, is scarcely enlarged by the change; for, if he hears
of any reference to the book of life, it is only for a partial
selection of bare and isolated texts, that may be calculated to
uphold the members of one religion, and misrepresent the abettors
of another.&nbsp; Thus enveloped in unscriptural darkness, the
individual enters into the collegiate department as the last
preparation for his missionary labors.&nbsp; But here, also, the
advantages of Scriptural knowledge become partially contracted;
for that time which should be occupied in searching the word of
God, is nearly engrossed with what are called the quibbles of a
moral theology.&nbsp; Such, my friends, you know to be the
description of him whose means would allow a similar preparation
for the priesthood; and as such it is perfectly applicable to him
who is the writer of these lines.&nbsp; Such were the
difficulties I had to encounter&mdash;such were the prejudices I
had to combat&mdash;and such must be my apology for the deferring
of my conversion those years back.&nbsp; It was only when placing
my hand on the Bible, and saying that its contents should form
the ground-work of my faith, the bulwark of my salvation; it was
only then the spirit of God had <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>entered into my heart, giving me both
the understanding to perceive, and the courage to acknowledge my
error.&nbsp; May the same spirit guide you into a similar
perception of your errors, and a similar fearlessness as to their
acknowledgement.</p>
<h3>SECOND PART.</h3>
<p>Having mentioned, my friends, in the preceding part of this
pamphlet the kindness you had always exercised towards
me&mdash;the worldly comforts I could enjoy by remaining in your
church, and the difficulties I must now encounter by separating
from your communion, I will submit to you in the two subsequent
parts of my pamphlet, some of the reasons that have influenced my
conduct upon so important a change in life.&nbsp; I will not
dwell, however, upon those doctrines, with which, from your want
of Scriptural knowledge, you are but little acquainted: and
though I do not now detain you on the doctrine of Justification
by Faith, still you must admit, as the Apostle says, &ldquo;that
without faith it is impossible to please God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Therefore no act of ours can be considered as good or acceptable
in the sight of God, except faith be its foundation.&nbsp; Again,
no matter how good or acceptable those works may be in the sight
of God, still they cannot be said to merit salvation; for it is
mentioned in the 2d chap. 8th and 9th verses of the
Ephesians&mdash;&ldquo;By grace are you saved through faith, and
that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest
any man should boast;&rdquo; and therefore it is not according to
our own merits, but through the merits of Jesus Christ, that
salvation can be acquired.&nbsp; But, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>my friends, this does not exclude the
necessity of good works upon our part, for our good works must be
conformable to our faith in Christ, of which they are the
external evidence.</p>
<p>I will not dwell either, upon the doctrine of Infallibility,
so falsely claimed by the Church of Rome, as it would require
more than the compass of this pamphlet would allow, to make its
name even intelligible to most of you; although I might briefly
hint at the wild supposition of a few fallible beings meeting
together and constituting an infallibility; as much as to say,
that a compound of any thing may contain that which is
essentially different from its parts, which appears to me as most
extravagant.</p>
<p>As to your doctrine of the invocation of saints, I will not
detain you for any time upon this subject.&nbsp; I never believed
in the necessity of invoking them; nor does the intelligent
portion of Roman Catholics believe in the necessity of invoking
them; nor do any of your divines who have the least pretensions
to learning, attempt to say that it is indispensably requisite to
have recourse to the invocation of saints: for though your
Council of Trent, in the twenty-fifth session, would appear to
some to be quite explicit upon the subject, still your divines,
in interpreting that council, agree that it is only useful and
profitable, but not indispensably requisite for you to have
recourse to the intercession of the saints.&nbsp; Such an
assertion may be a matter of surprise to some of my Protestant
friends, but to you let it serve as a subject of utility: and
lest it might be considered as the result of artful invention
with me, I will now give you the words of your favorite divine,
Dr. Milner, on the occasion.&mdash;<a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>In his book entitled &ldquo;The End
of Controversy,&rdquo; and in his &ldquo;Thirty-third Letter to
James Browne, Esq.&rdquo; he says&mdash;&ldquo;In conclusion you
will observe that the Council of Trent barely teaches that it is
good and profitable to invoke the prayers of the saints; hence
our divines infer that there is no positive law of the church
incumbent on all her children to pray to the saints.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such are the words of your respected but now deceased Rev. Dr.
Milner.&nbsp; He died a few years ago.&nbsp; The bare mention of
his name carries to each of you the recollection of his
character.&nbsp; He was looked on as the standard of your faith,
as the almost infallible guide in your religion.&mdash;His words
are only expressive of the real sentiments of your other divines
upon this subject; so that, my friends, you may observe that it
is only a partial ignorance among some of you as to the real
doctrine in this respect, that points to so wide a distinction
between you and my Protestant brethren.</p>
<p>Nor shall I dwell upon the doctrine of confession, the modern
observance of which I may at some future period shew to be
neither conformable to the word of God, nor sanctioned by the
practice of the apostolic age.&mdash;And now, my friends, to
speak most seriously on the subject, has it not often lulled you
into a most dangerous security, that your sins were forgiven you,
when you had neither sorrow for the committal of, nor the
determination not to commit those crimes again?&mdash;However I
shall not dwell upon those doctrines at present; but shall now
direct your attention to that doctrine with which you are most
acquainted&mdash;I mean Transubstantiation.&nbsp; I will in this
second part of the pamphlet point out to you my reasons, which,
guided by <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>the spirit of truth, led me to a disbelief upon this
subject of Transubstantiation: and in the third part of this
pamphlet, I will produce to you the scriptural arguments that
have confirmed my conviction as to that disbelief.&nbsp; But
first, I must lay down the doctrine of Transubstantiation
according to the Council of Trent.</p>
<p>Roman Catholics assert, that during the mass, according to the
words of the Council of Trent, ses. 13 and can.
2&mdash;&ldquo;That the entire substance of the bread is
converted into the body, and the entire substance of the wine
into the blood of Christ, the appearances of the bread and wine
only remaining, and this is called Transubstantiation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I assert, that such a supposition is directly contrary to
our senses and our reason, and as such, is unworthy of our
belief.&nbsp; The senses are the avenues or inlets to our reason,
while reason becomes the voice of God himself speaking unto
us.&nbsp; Reason is the medium of communication between the
Creator and the creature.&nbsp; It is the standard of our
judgment, and the supreme tribunal where all our knowledge is
acquired, and where the existence of the Deity himself becomes
discovered to the human mind.&nbsp; Yes, reason is that grand
feature, the reflection of the divinity, which in a great degree
assimilates man to the image of his Creator; and thus it is, that
when the senses give their united testimony as to the existence
of an object, and that reason stands forth to pronounce upon the
veracity of their assertion, to such conclusive evidence the
scriptures attach the seal of infallibility; and it would be
blasphemous (according to the words of Christ himself to the
Jews, in the case of Lazarus) to deny the force of their
allegation.&nbsp; I do <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>not want here to summon before the
bar of finite comprehension the infinite power of Eternal
Providence&mdash;I do not want to uncover the veil of the
sanctuary, and pry into the mysteries of that Eternal Being,
which hath made darkness his dwelling place, and the thick clouds
the pavilion of his glory&mdash;I do not deny that the ways of
God are unsearchable&mdash;that his divine essence is above the
reach of human senses&mdash;that there are invisible truths far
beyond the human comprehension, and that man cannot dive into the
unfathomable depths of the Trinity or Incarnation.&nbsp; But is
the composition of a little water and flour beyond the reach of
my understanding? and when my reason and senses unite in telling
me that that composition of flour and water cannot be changed
into the body and blood of Christ without implying a principle of
self-destroying contradiction, let me ask, is it not more natural
to obey the dictates of my reason, telling me, that God will not
transgress that moral restraint which the formation of his own
laws has voluntarily imposed upon him, is it not better that I
should do so than that I should attribute to the Godhead some of
the most unaccountable extravagancies that human reason could
suggest?&nbsp; Let justice but decide, and truth will bow in
affirmation of the remark.</p>
<p>But Roman Catholics, in support of their doctrine of
transubstantiation, say, &ldquo;Cannot he who has formed the
heavens and the earth&mdash;who has created all things, visible
and invisible&mdash;who has changed the rod of Moses into a
serpent, and the waters into rivers of blood in Egypt&mdash;who
has changed Lot&rsquo;s wife into a pillar of salt, and who has
changed the water into wine at the marriage of Cana, cannot he
(say they) empower <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>the priest, representing the person of Christ, to change
the bread into the body, and the wine into the blood of
Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friends, in my answer to this, let it not be understood
that I want to circumscribe infinite power within the narrow
precincts of human limitation.&nbsp; I do not want to append to
Eternal Providence the confined restrictions of mortality.&nbsp;
I know that infinite wisdom can contrive, and infinite power can
execute far more than human reason can comprehend; but while I
admit the truth of these appeals to divine power in the one
instance, I must reject the false supposition of change in the
other.&nbsp; For, when God changed the rod of Moses into a
serpent, and the waters into rivers of blood in Egypt, or when
our Saviour changed the waters into wine at the marriage of Cana;
these were changes that were palpably evident to the senses, that
the senses judged of, and were not contradictory to reason.&nbsp;
But, with regard to the supposed change, during the time of the
mass, of the bread into the body, and the wine into the blood of
Christ, allow me to tell you, my friends, that I have considered
such a change to be contrary to my senses and most repugnant to
my reason.&nbsp; For, as often as I had taken into my hands that
bread to bless, I found it the same, after, as previous to
consecration; having the same texture, presenting the same form,
and producing to my mind the self same identical effects.&nbsp;
As often as I looked on it after consecration, I observed it to
be bread&mdash;when I touched it after consecration I felt it to
be bread; and &ldquo;if faith&rdquo; (as the Roman Catholics must
have it) comes from hearing and not from seeing, when I broke the
bread after consecration, I both <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>saw and heard the result of its being
bread; reason then told me that it was more or less blasphemous
to deny the united testimony of my senses giving such unbroken
evidence to facts so perceptible to their powers, and I have
yielded to such conviction.</p>
<p>Oh, my friends, I had often thought during the time of the
mass, that if I could change the bread into the body and the wine
into the blood of my Redeemer, that I would consequently possess
a most exorbitant power&mdash;that I would transcend by the
nobleness of my act the infinite majesty of heaven
itself&mdash;that my Creator should be at the beck of my
fancy&mdash;that whenever or wherever my will suggested, I might
summon Him from the throne of his Eternal Majesty and convert
upon the altar of frailty a little scrap of insignificant bread
into the body, the blood, the soul and divinity of my
Maker.&nbsp; Oh, my friends, that God who measureth the tops of
the mountains in a balance, and the waters of the sea in the
hollow of his hands&mdash;that he, who rideth upon the
whirlwinds, making the earth his footstool and the canopy of
heaven his covering&mdash;that he, who formed the heavens and the
earth, all things visible and invisible&mdash;that he should
descend from his eternal throne to enter into the womb of a
virgin mother&mdash;there to be inclosed for the long space of
nine revolving months, and afterwards to be born, in time, under
the figure of a mere child&mdash;under the form and the habit of
a poor slave; oh, my friends, it is human redemption alone, could
call for such an act of humiliation.&nbsp; But that the Saviour
of the world, after having offered one, eternal, immeasurable and
unspeakable sacrifice for the sins of mankind, and that after
having been placed by his own irrevocable <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>decree at the
right hand of God, that he should descend from his throne of
eternal justice upon the altar of human weakness, and that there,
at the mere announcement of a few insignificant words, falling
from the lips of a poor weak mortal, he should suffer a wretched
collection of diminutive portions of bread, of similar figure, of
similar size, but of similar material as common wafer&mdash;that
he should suffer them to be converted into his Infinite
Majesty&mdash;that that Infinite Majesty should continue whole
and entire under each such particular species of bread&mdash;that
afterwards he should allow his boundless omnipotence to be
confined within the narrow precincts of a poor miserable little
box, commonly called a pixis, and then to be hacknied about from
place to place, and distributed from person to person according
to the whim or caprice of human suggestions&mdash;such, my
friends, I have considered, would be unworthy of Infinite
Majesty&mdash;would be derogatory to his eternal
attributes&mdash;subversive of the principles of that humanity
with which God had vested himself, and contradictory to those
words which I hold as unalterably true, that if the resurrection
has added glory to, it has not annihilated the humanity of a
Redeemer.</p>
<p>But you, Roman Catholics, will assert, as an objection to what
I have now laid down, that as the senses deceived us in some
respects they may for a similar reason deceive us with regard to
Transubstantiation: and in proof of your assertion you will say
(as others have said already) &ldquo;that the senses were
deceived with regard to the Holy Ghost descending in the form of
a dove upon our Saviour receiving baptism from John;&rdquo; and
again you will say, &ldquo;that the senses have been deceived,
inasmuch as they <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>often imagined angels to be men;&rdquo; and therefore
you will conclude, (as many other Roman Catholics have done) that
our senses are also deceived with regard to
Transubstantiation.</p>
<p>But, my friends, in the above instances the senses did not
deceive, inasmuch as the sense of vision or of sight, judges only
from appearances, and therefore its testimony in the cases quoted
was true.&nbsp; But who would assert that all the senses combined
together in the above instances were deceived; for, if all the
senses were deceived, how could reason pronounce upon the Holy
Ghost being in the form of a dove, or the angels being in the
appearance of men, since it was from the senses only that reason
formed its judgment upon those occasions?&nbsp; And hence it is,
that while in certain cases, one portion of the senses imparts
the language of appearances, in the very same cases, another
portion of our senses implies the language of reality.&nbsp; And
thus it is, that when the senses, in their unimpaired and natural
state, view objects at a proper distance and through a proper
medium, and that reason pronounces on their veracity, disbelief
can be no longer attached to their allegation, and therefore it
is, that Transubstantiation must be false; for the bread is a
quite palpable and perceptible object to the senses.&nbsp; The
sight tells that it is not the body&mdash;the touch feels it is
not the body&mdash;the taste is convinced of its not being the
body&mdash;and the hearing, from the result of sound, joins in
the assertion that it is not the body; while reason also attests
the impossibility of its being the body of Christ.</p>
<p>If the senses were to deceive us in objects so perceptible to
their powers, and were that to be pronounced as <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>true, what
reason declares as a contradiction, then deceit might be ascribed
to the Deity&mdash;then it might be asserted, that men were led
into an inexplicable chaos of illusions, and impostures, and that
reason and the senses, which we have received from the beneficent
author of nature, as the mediums of our preservation and
happiness, were only the gifts of a demoniac power, with the
words of no reliance marked on their formation.&nbsp; Oh, my
friends, were the senses to be deceived in their combined
testimony upon objects so perceptible to their powers as bread
and wine, then universal Pyrrhonism would follow, that is a doubt
as to all things and a belief as to nothing&mdash;then would all
the arts and sciences be subverted, and then would the existence
of the Deity stand without proof&mdash;then the noble structures
of religion would totter to their base&mdash;revelation itself
would be at an end&mdash;the death, the resurrection, the
ascension and miracles of our Lord, these mighty bulwarks of a
Christian&rsquo;s faith, would be overthrown; for, are not the
senses the great external arguments and evidences of
Christianity?</p>
<p>Before I conclude my remarks upon this part of the subject,
allow me to make them obvious to the capacity of each of you, by
one example.&nbsp; Suppose an individual told me, that this pen,
which I now hold in my hand, was in reality a man; why, I should
instantly deny the assertion, and say, this is impossible; for
the united testimony of my senses and my reason tells me, that
this pen is not a man, as it has neither the appearances nor
properties of a man&mdash;that my senses and reason are the gifts
of God&mdash;that, therefore, they cannot deceive me, with regard
to an object so palpable, so perceptible <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>to their
powers, and that therefore I conclude, this pen is not a
man.&nbsp; But, should the supposed individual go farther and
say, &ldquo;I would not tell you a lie, and will prove by
miracles that the pen which you hold in your hand is really a
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miracles I would say!&nbsp; Is it not my senses
that are to judge of your miracles; and if my senses deceive me
with regard to this pen, what is to prevent them from deceiving
me also with regard to your miracles; for if they be deceived in
one case, a similar reason may imply deceit in the other?&nbsp;
Therefore that the miracles of our Lord may not be exposed to
uncertainty&mdash;that the death, resurrection and ascension of
our Redeemer may not be liable to doubt&mdash;that the certainty
of all human knowledge&mdash;the very consciousness of our own
being, and that the very existence of the Deity may not be
rendered dubious; in fine, that a doubt as to all things, and a
belief as to nothing, may not follow, it is necessary to believe,
that the senses could not deceive us with regard to objects so
perceptible to their powers; and therefore, I consider, that the
doctrine of Transubstantiation must be false, as being directly
contrary to our senses and most repugnant to our reason.</p>
<p>Among the many reasons that influenced my disbelief as to the
doctrine of Transubstantiation, there is another which I have
considered to be of no trivial tendency on the subject.&nbsp; I
could not conceive that a finite or material substance could be
in two or more places at the same instant of time: that is, I
could not imagine those years past, that the body of our Saviour,
which the resurrection has not deprived of its humanity, could be
wholly and substantially in my hands, and wholly and <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>substantially
over many portions of the globe, at the same identical moment;
for I consider that finite substances, whether glorified or
corruptible, must be subject to finite laws and regulations.</p>
<p>I know there are some however who would say, &ldquo;that
according to the principles of metaphysical or philosophical
observations, that it could not be proved, that it is impossible
for one body to be in many places at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, my friends, a primary truth or self evident principle is
not to be lost among the mysterious windings of metaphysical
subtleties; and when reason fully comprehends or clearly
understands a subject, and pronounces truth over the object of
its comprehension, the mad ravings of an unrestrained philosophy
are not to be credited, when suggesting a mere suspicion of
falsehood.&nbsp; Oh, my friends, to say that the same body could
be wholly and substantially in my hands during the time of the
mass, and wholly and substantially in the hands of thousands of
others at the same identical moment, and to require a belief of
such an assertion, would be demanding a complete surrender of
common sense&mdash;a prostration of the human
intellect&mdash;while it would be divesting man of that grand
attribute, that noble characteristic of his being&mdash;I mean
reason, which is the pure gift of God.</p>
<p>But Roman Catholics say, &ldquo;we do not understand the
meaning of the Trinity; that is, we do not understand how three
persons constitute one God, and therefore say they, though we do
not comprehend how the body of Christ could be in many places at
the same time, still we should believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>But, my
friends, there is no comparison between the two cases; for when I
assert that three persons constitute the unity of a God, I do not
mean to say that they constitute that unity in the self same
sense, but that they constitute that unity in a distinct sense;
and therefore it is not impossible, nor contradictory to my
senses, nor repugnant to my reason to make use of such an
assertion.&nbsp; But that three or a thousand material bodies
should constitute one body, and that one body should constitute
three or thousands of bodies, this is what I consider to be
impossible in itself, and most contradictory to my senses and my
reason, but of which Transubstantiation requires a firm belief:
for a person believing that doctrine, must believe that the body
which one priest holds in his hands, wholly and substantially,
must be also wholly and substantially in the hands of thousands
of others.</p>
<p>But you, Roman Catholics, again say, &ldquo;we do not know the
nature of a glorified body, and therefore you conclude that the
glorified body of Christ might be in many places at the same
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seems to me absurd; for though the resurrection had added
glory to, still it has not annihilated the humanity of
Christ.&nbsp; This is evident, first, from the words of Christ to
his Apostles collectively; for when he appeared among them after
his resurrection, he said, as is mentioned in Luke xxiv.
39&mdash;&ldquo;Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh
and bones as ye see me have.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore the
resurrection has not abolished the humanity of our Saviour.&nbsp;
Again, our Saviour said to Thomas, as is mentioned in John xx.
27&mdash;&ldquo;Reach hither thy finger and behold my hand; and
reach hither <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>thy hand and thrust it into my side.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Therefore, from these two passages, the one addressed by our
Saviour to the Apostles collectively, and the other to St. Thomas
individually, it is evident that the resurrection has not
abolished the humanity of Christ, but that he has flesh and bones
like us, even in his glorified state.&nbsp; If he has flesh and
bones like us (as has been already proved to you,) his body must
necessarily be a finite substance&mdash;if a finite, or what is
the same, a limited substance, it must necessarily be subject to
finite or limited laws&mdash;if subject to limited laws, it
cannot be consequently in many places at the same time.&nbsp;
Therefore the belief as to Transubstantiation must be false.</p>
<p>But, my friends, more of you, Roman Catholics, say upon this
subject, &ldquo;that as the body of our Saviour entered into the
room where the Apostles were assembled together, though the
windows and doors were closed at the time, that therefore the
body of our Saviour was and can be in many places at the same
time.&rdquo;&mdash;The answer to this is plain; for in order that
this objection would hold good on the present occasion, it would
be necessary to shew that when the body of our Saviour was in the
room with the Apostles, it was also in another or a thousand
different places at the same instant of time.&nbsp; Many natural
reasons also could be given as to how the body of our Saviour
might have entered the room of the Apostles without their
perceiving him enter, or without supposing that his body was in
many places at the same time.</p>
<p>There are more Roman Catholics who, in endeavouring to explain
the mode by which our Saviour&rsquo;s body might be present in
many places at the same time, assert, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>&ldquo;that as our Saviour fed the
multitude of the five thousand with five loaves, without any
increase as to the number of the loaves, that therefore our
Saviour&rsquo;s body could, by a similar mode of reasoning, be
received by many at the same instant.&rdquo; <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; But, my friends, in order that
this argument would hold good in the present instance, it would
be necessary that each of the multitude referred to would eat an
entire loaf wholly and substantially, without part or parcel; for
Roman Catholics hold, that it is not a part of our
Saviour&rsquo;s body, but the whole of his body, which is taken
by each individual, on receiving their sacrament.</p>
<p>Some Roman Catholics also endeavour to show our
Saviour&rsquo;s body could be present in many places at the same
time, &ldquo;by attaching to it a velocity, or what is the same,
a quickness, which would be almost equal to an infinite velocity
or quickness; so that no sensible interval of time would exist
between a body being here and a thousand separate parts of the
globe at the same instant.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this is totally
subversive of the doctrine of Transubstantiation; for, no matter
how great the velocity or quickness of the body might be, still,
if that quickness were not equal to an infinite quickness the
doctrine of Transubstantiation could not be proved.&nbsp; For,
some interval of time (if the velocity be not equal to infinite)
must exist between the body of our Saviour being here, being in
France, being in America, and in a thousand other places, which
is contrary to Roman Catholic doctrine; which asserts,
&ldquo;that as long as the species of bread and wine continues,
so long does Christ exist in the sacrament;&rdquo; which words
clearly prove, that our <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Saviour&rsquo;s body is not to leave
the sacrament at any time, and, therefore, such a supposition of
quickness being attached to the body of Christ, is perfectly
absurd and contradictory to Roman Catholic doctrine.</p>
<p>Again, such a supposition of velocity or quickness equal to
what they would term almost infinite, is quite absurd.&nbsp; For
it is proved, from the most natural deductions of the accelerated
motion of moving bodies, &ldquo;that if each ray of light were
equal to the two-millioneth part of the smallest portion of sand
we can form a conception of, that man could no more stand before
their effects, than before grape shot fired from the mouth of a
cannon.&rdquo; <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; If such then would be the effects
of the rays of the sun upon bodies, what would be the result of
the bread upon the Priest, if a million of times greater velocity
would be imparted to that bread?&nbsp; Why, my friends, the
effect would be tremendous&mdash;death would be the immediate and
necessary consequence to the priest officiating.&nbsp; Therefore,
such a supposition as that of &ldquo;an almost infinite
velocity,&rdquo; is absurd.</p>
<p>Such, my friends, are some of the reasons, which inspired by
the spirit of truth, have influenced my disbelief as to the
doctrine of Transubstantiation.&nbsp; I know some of you will say
it is difficult to understand some of those reasons I have given
on this subject; but remember it is only the quibbling objections
that are made in support of this doctrine that are difficult to
be understood, and not the answers I have given, for I have
endeavoured to make those answers as plain as possible to the
capacity of each.&nbsp; I will now proceed to these Scriptural <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>arguments
which confirm me in the disbelief as to your doctrine of
Transubstantiation.</p>
<h3>THIRD PART.</h3>
<p>But, my friends, before I enter upon these Scriptural
arguments, allow me to remind you of one important
circumstance.&nbsp; Do you remember some time ago how anxious
your Bishops and Clergy were in preventing the diffusion of the
Gospel light among the people of Ireland?&nbsp; Do you remember
how all their energies were directed against those Missionaries
who so indefatigably struggled for the circulation of the Bible
among you?&nbsp; Well, my friends, I am now happy to inform you
that the times are quite altered&mdash;&ldquo;<i>tempora mutantur
&amp; nos cum illis mutamur</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as some of you
may not understand the meaning of those words I will translate
them for you&mdash;that is, &ldquo;the times are changed and we
are changed in them;&rdquo; for your Bishops have lately resolved
that a cheap edition of the Bible should be published for your
instruction.&nbsp; With mine own hands I circulated some of those
Bibles among you.&nbsp; I hope you will now avail yourselves of
such an opportunity, and that you will look to your Bibles for
those arguments to which I will now refer you.&nbsp; Let you
remember that these words are not mine, but the words of eternal
life.&nbsp; They are to be found in your own Bibles.&nbsp; Let
you therefore consider them diligently.&nbsp; I will not confuse
your minds by a reference to many texts of Scripture, but shall
only introduce those which I consider as essentially necessary
upon the subject of Transubstantiation; which means (as I have
mentioned before) the transubstantiating, <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>or what is
the same, the changing, during the time of mass, of the bread
into the body and the wine into the blood of Christ.</p>
<p>You assert that the sacrifice of the mass is the same as the
sacrifice at the last supper; and you also say that the sacrifice
at the last supper is the same propitiatory sacrifice as that
offered upon the cross, with this exception, that the sacrifice
upon the cross was a bloody one, but the sacrifice at the last
supper was an unbloody and mystical sacrifice.</p>
<p>Now, my friends, look to all those passages in your Bible
which describe the last supper&mdash;look to Luke the 22d
chap.&mdash;look to Mark the 14th chap.&mdash;look to Matthew the
26th chap.&mdash;look to the 1st Corinthians the 11th chap, and
in all these places you will not find a single word about a
mystical and unbloody sacrifice at the last supper.&nbsp; No, for
these are words of what I might call a self-accommodating
distinction&mdash;formerly introduced by the selfish views of
man&mdash;they are quite unscriptural, and therefore unworthy of
our belief upon so important an occasion.</p>
<p>I will now show you there was no propitiatory sacrifice at the
last supper, and consequently that there is no propitiatory
sacrifice at your masses, for you assert that the sacrifice at
the mass and the sacrifice at the last supper are the same.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Leviticus, 17th chap, and 11th verse,
&ldquo;for it is the blood that maketh atonement for the
soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this in the old law is confirmed by the
words of St. Paul in the new law, as may be seen in the 9th chap,
and 22d verse of the Hebrews, where it is said, &ldquo;and
without shedding of blood there is no remission.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Therefore
there was no propitiatory sacrifice at the last supper, or what
is the same, no sacrifice for the remission of sins, for you
Roman Catholics admit, that the sacrifice at the last supper was
an unbloody sacrifice, and therefore there is no sacrifice at the
mass, since the supposed sacrifice at the last supper and the
supposed sacrifice of the mass are considered the same.</p>
<p>Again I assert, there was no sacrifice at the last supper, for
St. Paul says in the 7th chap, and 27th verse of the Hebrews,
&ldquo;Who needeth not daily as those High Priests to offer up
sacrifices&mdash;for this he did once.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore if
he sacrificed himself but once, it is evident there was no
sacrifice at the last supper.&nbsp; Again, it is said in the 10th
chap. and 12th verse of the same Epistle, &ldquo;But this man
after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on
the right hand of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; If therefore our Saviour only
offered one sacrifice, that was the sacrifice of the cross, and
certainly not the supposed sacrifice at the last supper; and
consequently there is no sacrifice at the mass, since, as I
mentioned before, Roman Catholics assert that the supposed
sacrifice at the last supper and that of the mass are the
same.</p>
<p>Again I assert, there was no sacrifice at the last supper, for
there was no sacrificial act performed by our Saviour at the
time, nor the slightest intimation of a sacrificial act given,
nor any of those ceremonies which are connected with a sacrifice
gone through at the time by our Redeemer.&nbsp; Our Saviour was
simply at the table, surrounded by his disciples.&nbsp; No altar
was at hand&mdash;no victim suffered&mdash;no blood was shed, as
Roman Catholics admit, nor was there any offering made but a
simple <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>distribution of bread and wine made among the apostles;
and I believe you must allow, that you had never heard or read of
a sacrifice without some of those appendages of either an altar,
the suffering of a victim, the shedding of blood, or an offering
being made on the occasion, none of which were witnessed at the
last supper.&nbsp; Therefore there was no sacrifice at the last
supper.</p>
<p>Finally, I assert, there was no sacrifice at the last supper;
for if the sacrifice at the last supper were the same
propitiatory sacrifice as that offered on the cross, I ask, in
the language of candor and religion, what was the utility of our
Saviour going through the bitter ordeal of his passion&mdash;why
undergo the painful ceremony of being treacherously betrayed with
the signal of peace by one of his disciples&mdash;denied by
another, and abandoned by all in the hours of his
affliction?&nbsp; Why allow himself to be dragged like a common
malefactor from place to place&mdash;then to be clothed in the
garb of pretended loyalty, and afterwards to be greeted with all
the insulting gratulations of a mock king?&nbsp; Why remain tied
to a pillar, there to be most cruelly scourged afterwards to be
crowned with a diadem of thorns?&nbsp; Why undergo the pangs, the
torments, the excruciating agonies on the gibbet of a cross, and
then seal with his blood the cause of man&rsquo;s
redemption?&nbsp; Why all these, if the sacrifice at the last
supper were the same propitiatory sacrifice for the remission of
sins as the sacrifice on the cross?&nbsp; Oh, my friends, it has
been, and is my firm conviction, that if the sacrifice at the
last supper were the same as the sacrifice on the cross, it could
not be blasphemous to assert that the sacrifice of the cross was
nugatory&mdash;was an act perfectly useless&mdash;was
inconsistent with and unbecoming the attributes of the Deity;
and, therefore, I <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>conclude there was no sacrifice at the last supper, and
consequently no sacrifice at the mass, since, as I mentioned
before, the supposed sacrifice at the last supper and that of the
mass are the same in your opinion.</p>
<p>I know that Roman Catholics assert, that there is nothing hard
or impossible to God, and that, therefore, our Saviour could give
his body and his blood to his Apostles at the last supper.</p>
<p>Now, my friends, this assertion is perfectly incorrect; for
there are many things relatively impossible to God; when I say
relatively, I mean with relation to these laws which impose upon
the Deity a moral and voluntary restraint, which restraint he
cannot transgress in accordance with his divine attributes; and
hence it is, that, owing to those laws, God cannot cause a thing
to exist and not to exist at the same time; nor can he cause a
part of any material body to be greater than the whole substance
of that body, that part and entire substance remaining in their
self-same, sensible, and evidently unchanged state.&nbsp; But
those two unnatural suppositions must be credited, if we are to
believe that our Saviour gave his body and his blood to the
Apostles at the last supper.&nbsp; First, we should believe that
he existed and did not exist at the same time; existed, inasmuch
as he gave himself to the Apostles, and did not exist, inasmuch
as the Apostles consumed his body by eating it, and all this
while he was sitting and conversing with them.&nbsp; Therefore to
suppose, that our Saviour gave his body and his blood to the
Apostles at the last supper to be eaten by them would be to
suppose, that he existed and did not exist at the same time,
which is absurd, and relatively impossible on the part of
God.</p>
<p>Secondly, should we suppose that our Saviour gave his <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>body and
blood to his Apostles at the last supper, it would then follow
that a part of his body was greater than the entire of his
body.</p>
<p>In order to shew this, I will not advert to those who would
say, that our Saviour had actually partaken of the bread which he
had distributed among the Apostles, and consequently made his
mouth, which was only a part of his body, to consume his entire
body.&nbsp; I will not dwell upon such an assertion, but will
come to one no less evident; and that is, if our Saviour gave his
body to be eaten by his Apostles at the last supper, it would
then follow that he grasped his entire body within the narrow
compass of his hand, and thus make his hand, which was only a
part, greater than his entire body, as the container must
naturally be greater than the contained; and all this to be done
while that hand and body remained in the self-same, sensible, and
evidently unchanged form.&nbsp; Oh, repugnant words!&nbsp; Oh,
irreconcileable doctrine!&nbsp; Oh, monstrous assertion!&nbsp;
How can a man slumber under such a belief?&nbsp; How can he rest
in the consciousness of such an error?&nbsp; Methinks that should
an individual after serious reflection tacitly submit to such an
irrational belief, it would be requisite that he should be
invested by the Deity with faculties the very reverse, of what he
now enjoys; that he should possess a reason that would reconcile
truths that are intuitively evident with falsehoods that are
intuitively false; and which should unite principles that are
eternally true and immutably fixed, with those that imply
self-destroying contradictions.</p>
<p>I will give you another argument from the Scriptures, which
tended to confirm me in my disbelief as to the doctrine of
Transubstantiation.&nbsp; That my remarks upon this <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>subject may
be obvious to the capacity of each of you, I refer you now to the
22d chapter of St. Luke, which is explanatory of the institution
of the sacrament at the last supper.&nbsp; It is said of our
Saviour in the 19th and 20th verses of that chapter, &ldquo;and
he took bread and gave thanks and brake it, and gave unto them,
saying, this is my body which is given for you; this do in
remembrance of me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Likewise also the cup after
supper, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the New Testament in my blood
which is shed for you&rdquo; 20th verse.&nbsp; Now you Roman
Catholics assert, that the words in the 19th verse ought to be
taken in their literal sense, that is to say, that when our
Saviour spoke these things, &ldquo;this is my body,&rdquo; that
he actually converted the bread into his body and gave it to be
eaten by his Apostles.</p>
<p>But if I can shew you many passages both in the Old and New
Testament, where the word <i>is</i> must be taken in a
figurative, sense.&nbsp; I do not see what is to prevent the word
<i>is</i> (in the passage alluded to) from being also taken in a
figurative sense.&nbsp; But there are many passages in the Old as
well as the New Testament, where the word <i>is</i> must be taken
to signify represent, or, what is the same, where it must be
taken to signify the figure or memorial of a thing.</p>
<p>First, you will find in the 17th chapter of Genesis where God
speaking of the circumcision says, in the 10th verse, &ldquo;This
is my covenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the circumcision was not
transubstantiated into the covenant.&nbsp; Therefore the word
<i>is</i> in this passage must be taken in a figurative sense:
that is, to signify the figure or memorial of the covenant.</p>
<p>Look also to the 12th chapter of Exodus, where God <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>after having
spoken of the lamb that was to be sacrificed in memorial of his
passing over the houses of the Israelites and his smiting all the
first born in the houses of the Egyptians, he says, as is
mentioned in the 11th verse, &ldquo;It is the Lord&rsquo;s
Passover.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the word <i>is</i> in this passage
must be taken to signify represent, as the lamb could not be said
to be transubstantiated into the Passover.</p>
<p>There are also innumerable passages in the New Testament,
where the word <i>is</i> must be taken to signify
represent.&nbsp; First, St. Paul, speaking of the church, says,
&ldquo;it is the body of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the word
<i>is</i> must be taken to signify represent.&nbsp; In the 13th
chapter of Matthew, our Saviour says, in the 37th
verse&mdash;&ldquo;He that soweth the good seed is the son of
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, in the 38th verse of same chapter he
says, &ldquo;the field is the world;&rdquo; and in the 39th verse
of same chapter he says, &ldquo;the harvest is the end of the
world;&rdquo; and lastly, in Luke viii. 11, our Saviour says,
&ldquo;the seed is the word of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, as in all
those passages the word <i>is</i> must be taken to signify
represent, what is to prevent it being taken in the same sense in
Luke xxii. 19, where our Saviour said, &ldquo;this is my
body?&rdquo;&mdash;especially as in the following verse of the
same chapter it must be taken for represent, where our Saviour
says, &ldquo;This cup is the New Testament;&rdquo; for the cup
was not transubstantiated into the New Testament, as you must all
admit; and therefore it is that I was led to consider that the
word <i>is</i>, in the 19th verse of the 22d chapter of Luke,
should be taken in a figurative sense; especially as in that same
verse our Saviour said, &ldquo;Do this in remembrance of
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And finally, there is nothing so common in our
language as to make use of this word <i>is</i> in the <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>sense of
represent.&nbsp; For example, let me suppose that on passing
through Sackville-street, in Dublin, and that a stranger on
seeing Nelson&rsquo;s pillar would ask me, who is that?&mdash;I,
immediately understanding him, would say, that is Nelson: and
certainly the word <i>is</i>, in those passages, must be taken to
signify represent; for which reason, also, I was led to consider
that the word <i>is</i>, in this passage of our Saviour, must be
taken to signify represent, when he said, &ldquo;This is my
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know, my friends, that in opposition to these passages to
which I have alluded, that you would introduce as an objection
that passage in the first of the Corinthians, xi. 27, where it is
mentioned, &ldquo;Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and
drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the
body and blood of the Lord;&rdquo; from which words you would
wish to prove that the Apostles believed the real body and blood
of Christ to be in the sacrament.</p>
<p>But, my friends, let you consider by whom and for what purpose
the sacrament was instituted, and then your surprise will not be
excited at the Apostle expressing himself in such strong
language, although he would not believe that the real body and
blood of Christ were present in the sacrament.&nbsp; By whom was
it instituted?&nbsp; By Jesus Christ himself.&nbsp; For what
purpose?&nbsp; As a last bequest to mankind&mdash;as a
remembrance of that Jesus who left his throne of eternal justice
to enter into the womb of a virgin mother&mdash;that Jesus who
was conceived and born in time&mdash;who, during his mortal
pilgrimage of thirty-three years, suffered all the extremities of
privation to which human nature could be subject&mdash;and who
finally placed the eternal seal of his blood upon the cause <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>of
man&rsquo;s redemption.&nbsp; Is it a wonder then, that the
Apostle, though not believing the real body and blood of Christ
to be present, should have recourse to such strong language
against those who would violate the respect due to that
sacrament, which was to be a memorial of our Saviour, and which
was to shew forth the Lord&rsquo;s death until he come?&nbsp; Oh,
my friends, if you or I were in the same situation as the
Apostle, we would recur to a similarity of expression, to
announce our horror to the wretch who would approach with
polluted heart so sanctified a memorial; for whoever would
disrespect such a sacrament, might be naturally said to be guilty
of the body and blood of Christ.</p>
<p>My friends, before I close this third part of my intended
pamphlet, I find it indispensably requisite to advert to that
practice in your church, by which the priests prevent you from
receiving the wine in the distribution of what they call their
sacrament.</p>
<p>Now, my friends, this I consider not only to be a direct
infringement upon the words, but also a direct violation of the
command of our Saviour: for if the command of our Saviour, at the
institution of the sacrament, were more strict in one part than
another, it was surely more urgent with regard to the receiving
of the wine; for it is said in Matth. xxvi. 27, that our Saviour
after having taken the cup, and having given thanks, he gave it
to his Apostles, saying, &ldquo;Drink ye all of it;&rdquo; and as
it is said in Mark xiv. 23, &ldquo;They all drank of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now observe that this word <i>all</i> was not
annexed to the eating of the bread, but only to the drinking of
the wine, which circumstance must prove to the reflecting mind
this important fact, that as our Saviour foresaw <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the abuse
that in course of time would be adopted in the Roman church, by
withholding the cup from the people, he has been therefore more
urgent in his command as to the reception of the wine, than he
has been as to the reception of the bread.</p>
<p>I am aware that your clergy have recourse to many stratagems
in explanation of this difficulty.&nbsp; They say, that when you
receive the bread, you not only receive the body but also the
blood of our Saviour, and that therefore it is not requisite for
you to receive the wine.</p>
<p>But, my friends, in answer to this I say, that if our Saviour,
at his last supper, intended to give to his Apostles, in the mere
substance of the bread, both his body and his blood, what was his
utility in giving his body and his blood a second time in the
wine?&nbsp; To do so would be an act of supererogation&mdash;it
would be an act of perfect uselessness, and would be derogatory
to the Redeemer in the institution of so important a sacrament:
and hence I considered that withholding the cup from the people,
is a direct infringement upon the words of our Saviour.</p>
<p>But your clergy also assert, that our Saviour, at his last
supper, addressed the Apostles as priests, and not as the laity,
and that therefore he made it incumbent only on the Apostles to
receive the sacrament under both kinds.&nbsp; But, my friends, we
read of no such distinction made by our Saviour; and moreover,
when he said, &ldquo;drink ye all of this,&rdquo; he also added,
&ldquo;for this is my blood shed for many.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now his
blood was not shed for the Apostles alone, but also for the
flock; and hence I conclude, that the people should receive the
wine as well as the priests.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Again,
my friends, if this passage, &ldquo;drink ye all of this,&rdquo;
were directed to the Apostles alone, why is it that the priests
do not always receive under both kinds; for I know that when they
are not actually celebrating the mass, they only receive the
communion under one kind?&nbsp; This seems a perfect
anomaly&mdash;especially as our Saviour drew no line of
distinction between a priest officiating and a priest
communicating.</p>
<p>Finally, my friends, if these words, &ldquo;drink ye all of
this,&rdquo; were addressed to the Apostles alone as priests,
then the people should at no period of time have partaken of the
cup.&nbsp; But that the people did partake of the cup is evident
from the words of St. Paul in the 1st Corinthians, 11th chapter
and 28th verse, where he says, &ldquo;Let a man examine himself,
and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup;&rdquo;
which words of the Apostle were addressed to all the Corinthians,
and consequently proving to us that the laity as well as the
pastors, had partaken of the sacrament under both kinds.&nbsp;
Popes Gellasius and Leo ordered the wine to be taken by the
people on their receiving the sacrament; <a
name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> while it was only in the fifteenth
century, at the Council of Constance, that the use of the wine
was prevented.</p>
<p>I would then address myself to the heads of your church and
say, why is it that you who boast so much of the antiquity of
your doctrines&mdash;the antiquity of your religious
institutions&mdash;you, who in the hours of controversial
difficulties fly to the traditions of your antients, as the great
props of your vacillating arguments&mdash;the <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>last hopes of
your controversial safety&mdash;why you thus mutilate the
traditions of antiquity?&mdash;why depart from that practice as
old as Christianity itself?&mdash;why claim to yourselves a
greater portion of wisdom than he who has instituted, than he who
has ordained, than he who has sanctioned such a
sacrament?&mdash;why infringe upon some of the most important
words of a Saviour?&mdash;why violate that last impressive
command of a Redeemer, by withholding from the people a right,
which, if duly administered, must prove highly beneficial to the
receiver?&nbsp; Equivocation may give an answer to such
interrogations, but cool and dispassionate reason will receive no
apology.</p>
<h3>THE CONCLUSION.</h3>
<p>My friends, there was a time when the dungeon or the scaffold
would be the temporary but certain award of these my humble
efforts for religion&mdash;a time when the most exquisite of
tortures would follow a similar announcement of principle&mdash;a
time when the inquisitorial rack would either extort a
recantation of such sentiments, or point to some painful death as
a necessary consequence of their avowal&mdash;a time when the
Papal arm had wielded an ungovernable sway over the countries of
Europe; and when secular power was so entwined around the
ecclesiastical diadem, that a Pontiff&rsquo;s nod might be once
considered as a sufficient guarantee for the deposition of a
monarch&mdash;a time when a Pope Gregory the Seventh <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a> detained a Henry the Fourth, of
Germany, for three days naked and fasting at his gates, <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and suing for
mercy and absolution&mdash;a time when in the days of a Pope
Innocent the Third <a name="citation45a"></a><a
href="#footnote45a" class="citation">[45a]</a> the British crown
had lain beneath the feet of Papal authority; and when a John of
England was forced to yield obeisance to that edict which
proclaimed absolution to a people from their due allegiance to a
monarch.&nbsp; Yes, my friends, there was another period of time
when individuals, under the pretext of religion, and under, if
not the influence, at least the sanction of ecclesiastical power,
had frequent recourse to acts of punishment which no religious
creed should tolerate&mdash;a time when the manly and religious
sentiments of a Lord Cobham <a name="citation45b"></a><a
href="#footnote45b" class="citation">[45b]</a> had enkindled for
his body the fire of persecution; and when the open avowal of a
Ridley, a Hooper, a Cranmer, and a Latimer, <a
name="citation45c"></a><a href="#footnote45c"
class="citation">[45c]</a> had impressed upon their brow the
indelible sentence of religious martyrdom.&nbsp; But blessed be
God for all things, those times are past, and we now live in days
when a more refined civilization has contracted the unlawful
stretch of Roman church authority, and when the intelligence of
mankind points out to a safer way for the glorious spirit of
religious toleration.</p>
<p>Yes, &ldquo;old things are passing away, behold all things are
becoming new.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even the narrow compass of your own
days, furnishes to the reflecting mind a proof of the comparative
enlightenment of the times; and gives to religious hope a more
consoling assurance of a better futurity.&nbsp; That spell which
kept your minds in unscriptural darkness, is now broken; for your
Bishops have at length come to the resolution of letting the
Gospel light among you.&nbsp; A cheap edition of the Douay Bible
has <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>been
lately published for your particular instruction; and the Priest
that would now withhold it from your perusal must undoubtedly
wish to make a traffic of your ignorance.&nbsp; The number of
your holydays is curtailed&mdash;those days which were often
spent by some of you amid the scenes of drunken reveries, or in
the circles of lawless assemblages.&nbsp; Your Saturday
abstinence, which the superstitious times of a Gregory the
Seventh had generated, is now abolished; all of which
circumstances must form a remarkable epoch in the discipline of
the Roman Church.&nbsp; The number of your reserved cases is also
diminished.&nbsp; But here it may be requisite to apprise some of
my readers of the meaning which Roman credulity attaches to the
reservation of cases.&nbsp; A reserved case is generally termed
that from which an ordinary confessor cannot absolve his penitent
without a special privilege from his Bishop.&nbsp; Thus for
instance, some time ago it was a reserved case for any of you to
hear instructions in a Protestant house of worship.&nbsp; I have
known an instance when a respectable Roman Catholic, who is now
of considerable influence at the bar, was publicly denounced from
an altar, for the mere fact of attending a charity sermon
preached by a Protestant clergyman.&nbsp; But, my friends, it
seems that the progress of years may divest crimes of their
hideousness; and that this, which was once reckoned a reserved
case, may be now counted among the number of your ordinary sins;
for, I am now happy to inform you, that any officiating curate or
parish priest has obtained the supposed privilege of absolving
you from the imputed sin of receiving instruction.</p>
<p>I hope you will avail yourselves of whatever advantages <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>the
intelligence of the times may afford: and that the narrow or
selfish views of man will no longer control you in the exercise
of your judgment.&nbsp; Remember that &ldquo;the word of God is
fire tried,&rdquo; and that it has ever courted investigation,
while falsehood has always shrunk from inquiry.&nbsp; I know
there are many among the lay portion of Roman Catholics, who
would anxiously sever the link of their nominal adhesion to Roman
doctrine, but their fears of an after persecution prevent an
avowed acknowledgment of error.&nbsp; But, my friends, remember
that the troubles of this life are not to be compared with the
glory that awaits us in the next.&nbsp; &ldquo;For (as the
Apostle says) our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory.&rdquo; <a name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a>&nbsp; I pray then, &ldquo;That the God
of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you
the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; that
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, ye may know
what is the hope of his calling&rdquo; <a
name="citation47b"></a><a href="#footnote47b"
class="citation">[47b]</a>&mdash;and that ye may be strengthened
to say with me in the words of the Psalmist, &ldquo;In God I will
praise his word; in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what
flesh can do unto me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psalms 56th chap. 4th
verse.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
